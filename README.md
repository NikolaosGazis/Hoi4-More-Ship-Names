# Hearts of Iron 4 - More Ship Names mod

## Overview
A repository where you have the opportunity to contribute your creative suggestions openly, whether it's correcting typos, refining names that don't quite fit their categories, or infusing your tocuh into a specific category.

## How to Contribute
- Begin by forking this repository into your own.
- Start editing on what you wish to change/remove/add.
- After making your modifications, commit the request with a clear explanation of your changes.

## Notes
- Not every change or addition will be implemented directly into the mod available on the Steam Workshop. This repository serves as an interactive platform for suggesting changes, providing a more dynamic approach than the Steam comment section. All suggestions will be carefully reviewed, and updates will be incorporated in future uploads.
- When modifying the existing files, keep the layout the same and be guided by it.
- If proposing removals, it's beneficial to provide reasoning (e.g., duplication, incongruent category) for better understanding.
- For adding new ship lists to specific countries or formable nations, utilize the **template.txt** provided in the files section. Customize it according to your preferences and the context.
- With each new patch upload, corresponding updates will also be made available here for seamless integration.
